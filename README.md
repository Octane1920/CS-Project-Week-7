Project Reflection – CornerGrocer

This project was about makin a C++ program that could read a grocery list from a txt file and count how many times each item showed up. The goal was to fix the problem of doin this by hand, which would take forever and probably be full of mistakes. My program lets the user search for items, see a full list of all items and how many times they were bought, and even print a bar graph of it all.

What I think I did good was using maps to store the item data, it made the counting way easier. I also made a simple menu so it’s not confusing to use.

If I wanted to make the program better, I'd probably break it up into more smaller chunks or functions so it’s cleaner. That way it'd be easier to fix or add stuff later, and maybe even more secure if I wanted to use it for real.

Hardest part was getting the input file to actually load right. I had to mess with file names and where to save it before it worked. I figured it out by googling stuff and just tryin over and over.

Skills I’ll def use again are reading files, using maps, and thinking about how the user is gonna use the program. That helped a lot with organizing everything.

To make it easier to keep up with, I left some comments and used simple names for stuff so someone else could figure it out if they looked at it later. It’s also not too hard to add to if I wanna put more features in.
